# Copilot Instructions

## Typography Rules

- **Never use em dashes (`—`).** Use a regular dash (`-`) or rewrite the sentence instead.

## Content & Tone

- Jamie Arlin is a **Delivery Lead & UX Leader** who leverages AI tooling to improve software delivery and processes.
- She is **not** an "AI Strategist." Position AI as something she *applies*, not a title she holds.
- "Software delivery" is preferred over "products" since her work spans both products and process improvements.
